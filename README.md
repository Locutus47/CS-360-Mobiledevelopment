Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The Inventory App needed the ability to allow users to login in order to make use of the app. The app also needed a way to add and delete items and modify item counts. If an item reacts a count of 0, the app should sent out an sms alert (provided the user allowed this. This app was designed to allow different users to manage an inventory database.


What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The first feature the app required was an sql database and a database handler that oversaw the different query operations that the different screens would have to make. The first screeen is the basic, the login and atuhentication screen. The next screeen employs a tab layout which gives displays the main database, a list of "outs" and a method of adding or removing items from the database. Clicking on an item pulls up a screen in which counts can be auto increased by 12/24, removed by 1 or add/removed by a custom numer.


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I started by designing the various layouts and screens for the app. It's best to have some sort of backbone to build off of. Having the UI done is a good first step. I know all my component names and strings, so I can easily call them when it comes to writing the codee.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

Unfortunitly, I was unable to complete the project by the deadline to various life issues that occured. But that is one of the things to consider when tackling these projects, that you don't know the future. The best lesson is that you don't know what is ahead so you should work hard and work often. I do plan to finish the project as I don't like letting things go unfinished. It won't matter much for my educational endevours but it will still be something that I'll have more my portfolio.
